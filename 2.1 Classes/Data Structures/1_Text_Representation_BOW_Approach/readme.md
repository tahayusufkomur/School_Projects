In this project, we are aiming to use linked lists efficiently for storing and manipulating data. In this project, we use double linked list, which can assume like a table, 2 dimensional array and so. 

In this program, its only looks sub directories for txt files, the number of txt files is not limited. First program finds the common words in all txt's, then it finds the discriminator words for different categories, which give us strong information about the category.
