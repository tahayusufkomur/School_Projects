In this project, we are aiming to use tree data structure efficiently for storing and manipulating data. In this project, we use ternary tree, which has some specialities. In this program, the tree structured by the rules, never looses its balance. I mean, it keeps itself ok for the rules, wheter you add or delete some nodes.
