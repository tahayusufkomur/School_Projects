The aim of this course is to give you a feel for algorithms and data structures as a central part of what it is to be a computer scientist.
You should end it appreciating that understanding the algorithm and data structures used for some problem
is much more important than knowing the exact code for it in some programming language. 
You should be aware of the fact that there are often several algorithms for some problem, 
and one algorithm may be better than another, or one algorithm better in some circumstances and another better in others.
You should have some idea of how to work out the efficiency of an algorithm, though we won't cover detailed formal analysis.
You should be confident with algorithms expressed using both iteration and recursion, and have some idea of how to convert algorithms expressed using recursion into iteration.
You will be able to use and design linked data structures, but appreciate why it is good programming style to hide
the details of a data structure within an abstract data type.
You will appreciate how the inheritance mechanism of object-oriented languages enables you to write
generalised code expressing an algorithm or data structure in a way that may be used in a variety of real-world situations.
